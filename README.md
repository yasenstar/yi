## Model "YI" in Archi

在此使用 [Archi](https://www.archimatetool.com/) 工具进行模型化。如下概览：

This repository is trying to use ArchiMate Tool (Archi) to model the structure of YI, and find out the inner relationships that ancient Chinese people to describe the world & universe!

When you look as Tai Chi (NULL), Yin (0), Yang (1), then 4 phases (00, 01, 10, 11), 8 guas (000 to 111), and further 64 gua (000-000 to 111-111), and then finally adding six element (stick) consideration, you get 64 x 6 = 384 different changes patterns. The 0 - 1 pattern are always along with the change, so this model is aiming to use binary to label and position the elements and see how computerized methods are interactive with this ancient theory!
